# Linear Algebra 

This repository contains MATLAB Live Scripts (`.mlx`) for the practical projects of the Linear Algebra 401 course. The projects demonstrate the application of linear algebra in machine learning, signal processing, and system analysis.

## 📂 Project 1: Optimization & Machine Learning
* **Least Squares Regression:** Synthetic data generation and MSE minimization with regularization ($\lambda$, $\sigma$).
* **Fast Matrix Inversion:** Implementation of **Sherman-Morrison** and **Woodbury matrix identity** for efficient computation.
* **Neural Network Training:** Analytically deriving Gradient and Hessian for a Single-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and training via **Newton's Method**.
* **Recommender Systems:** Using **Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization** and projection-based prediction for rating systems.
* **Convolutions:** Manual implementation of 2D and 3D convolutions (CNN-style) without padding.

## 📂 Project 2: Dynamical Systems & Stochastic Processes
* **Stability Analysis:** Simulation of discrete-time dynamical systems and classification based on **Eigenvalues**.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Computing **Condition Numbers** and analyzing error propagation in linear systems.
* **Coding Theory:** Simulating signal transmission, linear encoding, and error detection using **Parity-Check Matrices**.
* **Markov Chains:** Simulating stochastic processes and computing steady-state convergence using the **Perron-Frobenius theorem**.

## 🛠 Requirements
* **MATLAB** (Live Scripts)
* No external libraries required; all algorithms are implemented from scratch.
